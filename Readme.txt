## Failed Integrations

### Google Maps API Integration:
- Initially, the website attempted to integrate the Google Maps API to display job locations in Japan.
- However, due to technical challenges or limitations, the integration was not successful.
- Future plans include revisiting this integration to enhance the user experience by providing visual representations of job locations.

### Job Listing Integration:

- However, this integration was also unsuccessful due to technical reasons or limitations.
- Future development efforts will focus on implementing job listing functionality to provide real-time job opportunities for users.
